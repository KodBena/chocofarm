chocofarm AZ — the action↔slot mapping for the policy head (design §3, staleness-corrected).

The policy head emits logits over a FIXED, env-derived slot space so the output layer is stable
while the LEGAL set shrinks/grows with the belief (masking handles legality; a face that becomes
uninformative is simply masked, no re-indexing — design §3). The mapping is kept HERE, in one
place, so `mlp.py`, `gumbel_search.py`, and `exit_loop.py` all agree on it by construction.

The design doc's "37-slot" space is STALE (it assumed the superseded 16-region detector model).
The honest `env` carries `env.N` collects + `len(env.detectors)` arrangement-FACE senses + 1
TERMINATE. On the live instance that is 20 + 44 + 1 = **65 slots**. Everything is derived from
`env`; nothing is hardcoded.

  slot 0 .. N-1            -> ("t", i)           collect treasure i = slot
  slot N .. N+nD-1         -> ("d", slot - N)    sense face id (slot - N)
  slot N+nD               -> TERMINATE          (always legal)

The legal mask is read straight from the FeatureBuilder's per-treasure `available[i]` block and
per-detector `informative[j]` block (the §2.2 features that ARE the mask, design §3), plus the
always-legal TERMINATE slot — so building the mask costs nothing beyond the feature vector that
was already built. `legal_mask_from_features` does exactly that, by slicing the known blocks.
