chocofarm/az/zmq_net_client.py — `ZmqNetClient`: the REMOTE `Net` impl that RPCs the Shape B inference
service (docs/design/zmq-inference-service.md §1, §5, §6).

It is the drop-in the parity harness checks and the REFERENCE the future C++ `ZmqNetClient` mirrors:
a worker holds one of these at the leaf and calls a blocking `predict(X) -> (value, logits)` — the same
raw `Net` port (net_port.py) a local `ValueMLPNet` satisfies, so a Python search uses local-or-remote
interchangeably with zero call-site change (the zero-cost ACL, design §1). The forward runs REMOTELY,
on the SSOT batched service; this client only encodes the request, round-trips it, and decodes the
`NetPrediction` (de-standardized value + RAW logits — masking stays client-side, design §2).

Transport: a ZeroMQ REQ socket (the lock-step request→reply peer of the server's ROUTER). REQ enforces
the strict send→recv alternation a blocking leaf RPC wants; the server's greedy-drain batches whatever
REQ requests are concurrently in-flight across many clients. The codec is the shared one
(inference_wire.py) — there is no second hand-written frame here (ADR-0012 P7).

Failure semantics (ADR-0002 / ADR-0012 P9 — design §5): a receive timeout (`RCVTIMEO`) or a transport
error is a LOUD raise (`InferenceClientError`), NOT a silent fallback to a local net — falling back
would mask the SSOT path being down, the exact silent failure ADR-0002 forbids. A malformed reply
(bad protocol byte, wrong length) is a loud `WireError` from the codec. There is no degraded-quiet mode.
(The Python client RAISES; the C++ `ZmqNetClient` will instead return `std::expected<…, Error>` per
ADR-0012 P9 rule 5 — same loud-typed-failure semantics in each language's idiom.)
